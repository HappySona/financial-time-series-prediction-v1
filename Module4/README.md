# Module4. Implementing Time Series Prediction Models (More Comprehensive)

*Will be released after Module3*

## Goal
- Learn how to implement your own neural network models with cryptocurrency data which includes bid/ask volumes, minute level prices and trading volumes 

## Modules
- M4.1 [Assignment] CNN Encoder + RNN Time Series Prediction Model with Limit Orderbook Data [[Problem]()] [[Solution]()]
- M4.2 [Assignment] Wavelet Transform to Denoise the Data [[Problem]()] [[Solution]()]
- M4.3 [Assignment] Stacked Autoencoders to Extract Features from Data [[Problem]()] [[Solution]()]
- M4.4 [Assignment] Final Neural Network Model [[Problem]()] [[Solution]()]
- M4.5 Summarizing
- M4.6 Assignment
- M4.7 Slack Discussion

## Q&A
- Module4. [Implementing Time Series Prediction Models (More Comprehensive)](../Q&A/Module4.md)

## What's next?
The beauty of this model is the once the construction is understood, the individual models can be swapped out for the best model there is. So over time the actual models used here will be different but the core framework will still be the same.
